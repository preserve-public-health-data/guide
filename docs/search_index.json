The CDX API may also be useful for writing custom scripts and programs due to its minimal nature. This guide will not comprehensively document the CDX API itself as the Internet Archive already maintains extensive documentation on their website. 6.3.1 Querying the CDX API The CDX API endpoint lives at http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx. The main parameters of interest are: url (string): The primary filter. Must be precent-encoded. matchType (string): Describes how url is matched. The following values will be the most useful: exact: Results must match url exactly (default if matchType is not provided); prefix: Results must begin with url. Other useful parameters: from and to (integer): Filters the results by date range. Must be given in the form YYYYMMDDhhmmss; partial information is allowed (for example YYYY or YYYYMMDD). limit (integer): Limits the number of results returned. The CDX API docs note that “the CDX server may return millions or billions of record[s]”, so this may be necessary for larger or older sites. fl (one or more strings, comma-separated): Chooses which fields are returned, and in what order. The most useful fields are: timestamp: The timestamp of the capture, formatted as YYYMMDDhhmmss. original: The original URL. Not ideal for filtering due to things like port specification; see urlkey instead. mimetype: The MIME type string. urlkey and \"digest\": The standardized URL and a checksum of the content, respectively. Useful for filtering out all duplicated URLs (urlkey) or only duplicated URLs with the same content (digest). collapse (string): Filters out results by the given field, returning only the first when ordered by date. See above for fields that can be passed to collapse. filter (string formatted like [!]field:regex): Use regular expressions to filter based on field values. Most common requests will take the form of http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=[URL]&amp;matchType=prefix, which will return all URLs beginning with [URL]. Outputs are sorted by URL and date. 6.3.2 Examples Note: &amp;limit=5 has been appended to all example request URLs.
