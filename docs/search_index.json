Installation instructions: Windows: Through the Windows Subsystem for Linux. macOS: Through Homebrew (brew install wget) or by compiling. Linux: Generally included by default; if not, consult your distribution’s package repository. Usage Useful command-line arguments For an exhaustive list, see the wget documentation or run man wget or wget --help. Examples 3.1.3 curl curl is another common data transfer tool that is much better suited for interactive use (for example to explore APIs, or in scripts that parse server responses) and supports a much wider array of protocols. Although it can also be used as a standalone download utility, it does not support recursive retrieval. Installation instructions: Windows: Through the Windows Subsystem for Linux. macOS: Included by default. Linux: Generally included by default; if not, consult your distribution’s package repository. Usage Useful command-line arguments For an exhaustive list, see the curl man page or run man curl or curl --help all. Examples 3.1.4 aria2 aria2 is another command-line download tool similar to wget that supports fewer protocols but may be preferable for downloading a large number of files for which the URLs are known. Unlike wget, aria2 marks incomplete or errored downloads as such (allowing for automatic retries on next run and for you to quickly check file integrity at a glance) and has better support for concurrency with URL-based, domain-based, and chunk-based parallelism. Installation instructions: Windows: Binaries available from the aria2 website. macOS: Through Homebrew (brew install aria2), or from the aria2 website. Linux: Consult your distribution’s package repository. Usage Examples 3.2 R 3.2.1 httr / [httr2] httr and httr2 are R wrappers around the libcurl library used by curl. Usage Examples 3.3 Python requests is a generic HTTP library for Python. Unlike httr and httr2 for R, requests does not build upon libcurl and instead uses urllib3.

If, for whatever reason, none of the above methods are available (for example on a headless server without the ability to install software), the CDX API can be used in conjunction with commonly-found command-line utilities to locate files for download. The CDX API is also useful for writing custom download scripts and programs or for exploring archived URLs. This guide will not comprehensively document the CDX API itself as the Internet Archive already maintains extensive documentation on their website. 5.3.1 Querying the CDX API The CDX API endpoint lives at http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx. The main parameters of interest are: url (string): The primary filter. Must be precent-encoded. matchType (string): Describes how url is matched. The following values will be the most useful: exact: Results must match url exactly (default if matchType is not provided); prefix: Results must begin with url. Other useful parameters: from and to (integer): Filters the results by date range. Must be given in the form YYYYMMDDhhmmss; partial information is allowed (for example YYYY or YYYYMMDD). limit (integer): Limits the number of results returned. The CDX API docs note that “the CDX server may return millions or billions of record[s]”, so this may be necessary for larger or older sites. fl (one or more strings, comma-separated): Chooses which fields are returned, and in what order. The most useful fields are: timestamp: The timestamp of the capture, formatted as YYYMMDDhhmmss. original: The original URL. Not ideal for filtering due to things like port specification; see urlkey instead. mimetype: The MIME type string. urlkey and \"digest\": The standardized URL and a checksum of the content, respectively. Useful for filtering out all duplicated URLs (urlkey) or only duplicated URLs with the same content (digest). collapse (string): Filters out results by the given field, returning only the first when ordered by date. See above for fields that can be passed to collapse. filter (string formatted like [!]field:regex): Use regular expressions to filter based on field values. Most common requests will take the form of http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=[URL]&amp;matchType=prefix, which will return all URLs beginning with [URL]. Outputs are sorted by URL and date. 5.3.2 Reconstructing the Wayback Machine URL from CDX API output Using only the timestamp and original fields, we can reconstruct archived URLs of the results returned by the CDX API as using the following template: https://web.archive.org/web/[TIMESTAMP]/[ORIGINAL] where [TIMESTAMP] and [ORIGINAL] are the timestamp and original fields, respectively. 5.3.3 Examples Note: &amp;limit=5 has been appended to all example request URLs.

See below for an example of how to reconstruct archive.org URLs that can be passed to those tools. The same as the previous example, but reconstruct the archive.org URLs using Bash (for example to feed into a download tool) curl &quot;http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=dpcpsi.nih.gov&amp;matchType=host&amp;collapse=digest&amp;filter=mimetype:application/pdf&amp;fl=original&quot; | while IFS=&quot; &quot; read urlkey timestamp original mimetype statuscode digest length do echo &quot;https://web.archive.org/web/${timestamp}/${original}&quot; done # From here, redirect to a file or pipe to a download tool 5.4 Common pitfalls 5.4.1 Non-nested websites and externally-linked resources Many of the common download tools and interfaces for interacting with the Internet Archive (including the CDX API) do not play well with sites whose content is not strictly nested. By this, we mean sites that utilise webpages that pull resources from: Other paths / domains of the same site, or Other sites entirely, such as content delivery networks. For example, the homepage of the NIH Sexual &amp; Gender Minority Research office, which used to live at https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sgmro, linked resources from: https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites (embedded images), https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/themes (stylesheets), and https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/core (scripts), all of which are located on different directory trees and so would not show up in queries of dpcpsi.nih.gov/sgmro. This issue is more prevalent on sites that make use of content management systems like Drupal or WordPress and sites that use website building and hosting services such as those offered by Wix.com and Squarespace. The most straightforward way to work around this issue is to: Query all HTML files from the site of interest, which should hopefully be nested; Download all of the returned URLs; and Parse the the downloaded HTML files to identify tags of interest and the URLs that they link to. For example, the following bash + htmlq code will dump the URLs of images referenced by HTML files in the current directory: find . -name &#39;*.htm*&#39; -print0 | xargs -0 cat | htmlq img -a src 5.5 Worked examples "],["storage-and-dissemination.html", "6 Storage and dissemination", " 6 Storage and dissemination "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
